# Compile-Protocol-Buffer-using-maven
This project explains how to compile Protocol Buffers schemas into Java sources in Maven.
Java build systems have always been a second class citizen for Protocol Buffers. As is the case for many other Java serialization frameworks (e.g., Cap’n Proto, FlatBuffers), Protocol Buffers does not provide a native Java compiler which you can inject into Maven dependencies and invoke a plugin to compile .proto files into .java sources. Hence, programmers needed to have protoc (Proto Buffers Compiler) binary on their development machine and call this platform-dependent binary during Maven build. This totally violates the environment independent build of a project. Fortunately, Google releases platform-specific protoc binaries in the form of Maven artifacts.
